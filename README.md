Course for react native app

We can create the react native app as:

yarn create expo-app RNCourse

if we need to run in an emulator, we need to run:
export ANDROID_HOME=${HOME}/Android/Sdk
export PATH=${ANDROID_HOME}/tools:${PATH}
export PATH=${ANDROID_HOME}/emulator:${PATH}
export PATH=${ANDROID_HOME}/platform-tools:${PATH}
to know where is our device
